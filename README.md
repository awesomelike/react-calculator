A beautiful [Calculator App](https://awesomelike.github.io/react-calculator/) (**that works**) made in React.

This project uses latest React features like Hooks, Fragments, and Context API for state management.

## Features
1. Fully functioning simple calculator, for the daily arithmetical calculations.
2. An ability to randomly change the background image. Powered by the generous [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) API.

You must have [Nodejs](http://nodejs.org) and [NPM](http://npmjs.com) to get up and running.

1. Clone this repo.
2. `npm install` to install the app dependencies.
3. `npm start` to run the development server, thus the app.
4. Have fun and solve some math :)
